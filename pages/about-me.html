								Jessica Hua is currently an undergraduate student attending DePaul University where she is pursuing a bachelor’s in Computer Science with a minor in Organizational Communication. As a computer scientist, she has worked on several projects such as program an enterprise application to mimic Best Buy, create an iOS application for grocery shopping trips, and build a movie rental database for customers to search and rent movies. She graduates spring of 2017 and hopes to find a career where technology and communication overlaps. 

								<br><br>

								Along with being a full-time student, Jessica is involved in organizations on campus such as Phi Sigma Pi, a National Honor Fraternity, and Phi Mu, a Panhellenic Sorority. She is one of the founding members of DePaul’s Phi Sigma Pi chapter. 
								In Phi Sigma Pi, she decided to take on a leadership position within the executive board as Secretary. While in this position, she enjoyed being able to see her ideas come to life as she helped build a solid foundation for the future of the fraternity. On the other hand, Phi Mu gave Jessica the opportunity to help plan philanthropic events to benefit Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.

								Outside of academics, Jessica works at Adidas located in the Water Tower Place in downtown Chicago. She holds the position of Cash Wrap Supervisor where she is in charge of approving returns, exchanges, and employee sales. In addition, Jessica trains new employees on cash wrap policies and procedures such as how to ring up sales, returns, and exchanges with accuracy. The position has helped her develop her leadership and training skills.
